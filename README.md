## Notes
* Local executables are not required to be handled.


## TODO
[ ] Check if the command given to pipex contains the abolute path ex. (/usr/bin/prog)
[ ] Check if the command given to pipex contains the relative path ex. (./prog)
[ ] Before adding the path to the cmd->cmd_paths check if we can run it with access.
[ ] Have an exit function that also frees our memory 
[ ] Bij iedere split in de envp meteen met access checken
[ ] ft_split handle commands in quotes ex. (grep "text text") also handle awk n stuff
